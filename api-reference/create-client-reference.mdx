While not strictly required to use the ValueChecker API, it is good
practice to create a Reference record prior to every usage session.
Think of it as a shopping cart where Appraisal records are collected and
can be modified prior to being retrieved into your system. The claim
reference number of a policyholder's claim can also be used as the
Client Reference. 

<Note>
If your implementation is only using the CP and RP steps, you may skip
creating a reference. 
</Note>

Client references have a user defined label (`client_reference`) and a
`client_reference_id`. The `client_reference_id` is used to interact with
the ValueChecker API to identify a reference.

<EndpointButton title="Create Client Reference Endpoint" href="/api-reference/default/client_reference-1" />

# List All References
To list your existing references (or ‘Carts’), you can use the same
endpoint. This returns all references belonging to the user the token
belongs to. 
No parameters are required

<EndpointButton title="All Client References Endpoint" href="/api-reference/default/client_reference" />


# Display Specific Reference
You should have a `client_reference_id` from [Step 1: Create Client
Reference](/api-reference/create-client-reference) to use in the request path.
