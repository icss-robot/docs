<Warning>
The endpoint **/client_reference** has restricted availability. Any
calls to it will result in a 404 response. You can request access from
your ValueChecker representative.
</Warning>

ValueChecker reports can be generated at the Client Reference level
(multiple Appraisals) or on a specific Appraisal.\
The response in both cases is a unique link to the document in PDF
format.

# Reference Report
The generated document lists all Appraisals from a Reference:
* Claimed products 
* Replacement products
* Offer links
* Product prices
* Actual Cash Values (ACV)

<EndpointButton title="Create Report For Client Reference Endpoint" href="/api-reference/default/client_reference-report" />

# Appraisal Report
This document lists all details from a specific Appraisal:
* Claimed products 
* Replacement products
* Offer links
* Product prices
* Actual Cash Values (ACV)

The layout is presented in a user-friendly format that can be shared
with [Claimants](/before-getting-started/valuechecker-service-concepts#users-and-policyholders).
