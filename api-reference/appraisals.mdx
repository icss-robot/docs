Creating an Appraisal record requires a Reference (or ‘cart’) id. A
Reference (or cart) can contain 1 or more Appraisals.\
You should have a `client_reference_id` from
[Step 1. Create Reference](/api-reference/create-client-reference)
(or [Step1.1](/api-reference/create-client-reference#list-all-references))
to use in the request path.

<Note>
If an identical Appraisal record exists in the same `client_reference`
(the same CPID and RPID), we will create a new appraisal record with a
different identifier (`appraisal_id`).
</Note>

# View All Appraisals
To view all/any Appraisals within a reference, call the same endpoint
without any parameters.\
You should have a `client_reference_id` from
[Step 1. Create Reference](/api-reference/create-client-reference)
(or [Step1.1](/api-reference/create-client-reference#list-all-references))
to use in the request path.

<Note>
Depending how the appraisal was created, the response may contain
additional values.

# Delete All Appraisals
To remove all Appraisals from a reference, call the same endpoint
without any parameters.

<Note>
This empties the Reference of all Appraisals but does not delete the
actual Reference itself.

# View An Appraisal
The appraisal_id (returned from [Create Appraisal](/api-reference/appraisals))
is required in addition to the `client_reference_id`.

# Delete An Appraisal

in the path.
