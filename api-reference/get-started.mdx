## API URL Path
The HTTP path to the valuechecker API is:
> https://api.valuechecker.net

There is only 1 accessible version and any changes to the path when new
generations are deployed will be updated in the documentation
accordingly.

## Authentication
ValueChecker uses API keys for authentication.\
You will receive an API key which you will provide on every request to
the API. If you do not have a key, ask your ValueChecker contact. 

To pass the API key in a request, use the “Authorization” header.
Prefix the key with “apiKey”.
```bash curl example
curl \
-H "Authorization: apiKey zcwPhya.S23UR5cN....xFWLdKq2KRLX" \
-X GET https://api.valuechecker.net/<endpoint>?query=param1&param2=40&param3=-1
```

You may request multiple API keys and call the ValueChecker API concurrently.

<Warning>
If you are still using a (deprecated) OAuth token, see [OAuth
Authentication](/api-reference/appendix#oauth-authentication).
</Warning>
