Search for products in our catalogs using a query string.

## Category Prediction

The ValueChecker API is capable of predicting the correct category based
on analysis of the search query string. Keep in mind this is highly
dependent on the richness of the query string.

#### Examples of rich search queries:

- `2008 lg washing machine front loader`
- `Wifi/4G Galaxy Watch Sport T-Buckle graphite`

Though it is not required, we recommend you use a category identifier
(`client_category_id`) or a category name (`client_category`) where
possible (i.e. when a category picker is available so the user can
select or define a category).\
[Read more about Client Categories](/before-getting-started/valuechecker-api-essentials#client-categories)

## Category Correction

When a search is made to a requested category that the ValueChecker
predicts with high certainty is the wrong category, a client feature
(enabled by ValueChecker) automatically performs the search and returns
results from the correct category.\
As a feature you can request to enable/disable this automation
correction depending on how your application user flow works (i.e. you
wish to show the user potentially poor or no results from the requested
category by design).\
Additionally, if you have Category Correction enabled, you can pass an
override parameter of `force_client_category` = `true` for specific
search requests that will prevent any category analysis or switching.

# Search Suggestions

For implementations that require fast or continuously updating results
for a query search (examples: "search as you type", instant display of
related series/models, drop-down or tree population based on options
etc..) you should call the search_suggestion endpoint.\
It returns structured response data from our Master catalog at a faster
rate than the [extended search](/api-reference/product-search#extended-search)
does. Additionally, calls to this endpoint have a much lower rate
metering restriction. You can call it without any throttling.

For example: in a "search as you type" scenario, every keystroke (after
the first X characters) can query this endpoint and you will get a
response with product data based on the updated string as fast as the
network allows which your implementation can then update/render to the
user.\
This endpoint returns a case insensitive, strictly matched result.
Misspellings and mistakes are not considered nor automatically
corrected.

Every request searches for results except when the search query matches
a brand name, or the beginning of a brand name. In this case, due to the
low specificity of the search, no results will be returned. For
instance: if the endpoint is called with the query "Apple" for the
client category "Mobile Phones", the search query would match any Apple
phone, so the chances of returning the product that is indeed being
searched for is very low. Therefore, in this case, the search query
needs to include at least two more characters after the brand name for
the Search Suggestion endpoint to begin returning results. In the
example above there will be iPhone results with a search query of
"Apple ip".

A product category (`client_category_id` or `client_category` from
[client_categories](/api-reference/query-parameter-requests#get-client-information))
should ideally be selected by the user (we recommend a
drop-down/list/other similar UI component be used for selection
purposes) to be passed as a parameter in the call for the claimed
product being searched for.\
There is support for the user to also be allowed to define their own
category which you pass to the API with the `client_category` parameter.

<Warning>
  Important: This feature is only available for our catalog categories where we have pre-calculated
  replacement data. You can find this flag from the results of the
  [client_categories](/before-getting-started/valuechecker-api-essentials#client-categories) endpoint
  where the category has a field and value of `"has_replacement": true`
</Warning>

```json example category
{
  "client_category_id": 11499,
  "client_category": "Smartwatches",
  "parent_client_category_id": 2427,
  "cid": 431051,
  "has_depreciation": true,
  "has_replacement": true,
  "acv_disabled": false,
  "show_closest_matches": false
}
```

<Note>
  **Results:** The result set may not be identical to the [extended
  search](/api-reference/product-search#extended-search) results as we only query our [Master
  products](/before-getting-started/valuechecker-service-concepts#master-product) for this endpoint. We
  recommend you add functionality to allow a user to perform an extended search if they are not satisfied
  with these results or when we do not have any Master products matching their search query (empty
  resultset).
</Note>

<Note>
  **Language:** The specification name (`spec_name`) values are currently only returned in lowercase
  English (please cast to the preferred format of your locale i.e. "Title Case" or "Camel Case" etc..).\
  Serving translations for the default locale of the requesting client (token) is under development and
  will be available in an upcoming non-breaking release.
</Note>

# Extended Search

A product category identifier `client_category_id` or a category name
`client_category` from [client_categories](/api-reference/query-parameter-requests#get-client-information)
should be selected by the user (we recommend a drop-down/list/other
similar UI component be used for selection purposes) to be used in the
call for the claimed product being searched for.

This action performs a sequence of tasks (such as auto-correction for
spelling typos, matching for [Master](/before-getting-started/valuechecker-service-concepts#master-product)
products etc..) and analyses a large set of potential results. It
returns a dataset of potential products within a series or product
family (for example "Apple iPhone 11" will return the different storage
variants of the standard, Pro and Pro Max models) or non-aggregate data
from a variety of data sources (general product data, web results
etc..).

This endpoint is metered and should not be called in a continuously
updating implementation (such as "search as you type" etc..).

```json example response
{
  "results": [
    {
      "child_products": [],
      "pid": 1122795690,
      "cid": 132,
      "category": "Laptops",
      "client_category": "Laptops",
      "client_category_id": 2000,
      "product_name": "Asus Zenfone 9 8GB 5G 128GB White",
      "Product_picture_url": "https://img.valuechecker.net/,..j",
      "specs": [
        {
          "spec_id": 999,
          "spec_name_display": "Marke",
          "spec_value_display": "Asus",
          "spec_value_numeric": 1.0,
          "spec_name": "Marke"
        }
      ],
      "price": {
        "price": 790.0,
        "price_url": "https://www.belsimpel.nl/asus-zen…",
        "shop_count": 1,
        "price_date": "2022-12-06 15:58:52"
      }
    }
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "category": {
      "requested_client_category_id": 1234,
      "requested_client_category": "Laptops",
      "prediction_certainty": 0.9978,
      "predicted_client_category_id": 469,
      "predicted_client_category": "Mobiele Telefoon",
      "category_switched": true
    },
    "used_query": "asus zenfone 2015"
  }
}
```

### Deprecation warnings

- `cid` has been deprecated and will be removed in a future update.
  Please use the `client_category_id` directly instead.
- `category` has been deprecated and will be removed in a future update.
  However, the `client_category` will return the same information.

If at least 1 `pid` is returned, use a `pid` to continue to
[Replacement Suggestions and Prices](/api-reference/replacement-product-suggestions).

The response example also shows the [Category Correction](/api-reference/product-search#category-correction)
feature being activated where a query for "asus zenfone 2015" was
performed in a requested category of "Laptops". The certainty of 99%
that this search should be performed in the category of Mobile phones
("Mobiele Telefoon" according to the client settings) triggered an
automatic switch of categories for the search and response.

### Reference Price

The Price returned here is a reference price. In many cases it is a
near-live or recent price that ValueChecker has obtained from multiple
internet sources (shops, search engines etc..). This price is not to be
confused with the Replacement prices from the [Replacement Suggestions
and Prices](/api-reference/replacement-product-suggestions).

### Child Products

When ValueChecker finds products that are equivalent in technical
specifications to a [Master Product]()
in our catalog but with minor variance in attributes (for example
color), the response will consist of the Master Product with the variant
products’ names in a nested list. The specifications of the child
product(s) are identical to the Master Product with the only difference
being in the product name. There is no difference in the replacement
calculation.

<Info>By default, the response contains an empty `child_products` key (value: empty list).</Info>

```json example response "iPhone 10 grey"
{
  "product_name": "Apple iPhone X 64GB (2017)",
  "child_products": [
      "Apple - iPhone X 64GB - Space Gray",
      "Apple - iPhone X 64GB - Space Gray (AT&T)",
      "Apple - iPhone X 64GB - Space Gray (O2)",
  ],
  "specs": [
    ...,
  ]
}
```

## Aggregated Prices (a.k.a. Clustered Prices)

For searches in [non-core categories](/before-getting-started/valuechecker-service-concepts#core-categories),
the ValueChecker will search many popular shopping APIs (Google shopping
for example) and collect all prices that match the search query. After
clustering the prices into 3 buckets of low, medium and high, the data
is available in the response for cases where you want to show average
prices to the application users.

An example response for a search for "Levis bluejeans":

<Note>note that no category information is requested.</Note>

> \{api_url_path\}/product_search?query=Levis bluejeans

```json Response (excerpt)
{
  "results": [
    {
      "pid": 1739972236,
      "cid": 135,
      "category": "Clothes",
      "client_category": "Clothes",
      "client_category_id": 3000,
      "product_name": "levi's blue jeans",
      "product_picture_url": "https://img.valueecker.net/...jpg",
      "price": {},
      "price_clusters": {
        "low": {
          "udc_id": 163332,
          "pid": 1739972236,
          "group": "low",
          "price": 51,
          "count": 7,
          "percentage": 0.28,
          "min_price": 39,
          "max_price": 61
        },
        "medium": {
          "udc_id": 163333,
          ...
        },
        "high": {
          "udc_id": 163334,
          ...
        }
      },
      "child_products": [],
      "child_product_contents": []
    }
  ],
}
```

The first item in the “results” object will have the keys"

- `price_clusters`: the object with the price cluster information.
- `udc_id`: This is the identifier of the product with the attached
  cluster weight: low, medium or high. There are 3 different udc_ids per
  product that can be used to [create an appraisal](/api-reference/appraisals).
- `price`: The median price of the cluster. Use this value as the
  cluster price.
- `percentage`: Ratio of the number of prices in the cluster compared to
  all prices found for the search.
