<Warning>
  The endpoint /client_reference has an availability setting. Any calls to it
  without the setting enabled will result in a 404 response. You can request
  access from your ValueChecker representative.
</Warning>

ValueChecker is able to calculate payouts (before standard deductions apply)
by using the depreciation values provided by the insurance company. This
is accomplished by providing user-input parameters like the date of damage
and the date of purchase in the request -- along with other, previously
obtained parameters detailed below.

# Perform an ACV Calculation

<EndpointButton
  title="Perform ACV Calculation Endpoint"
  href="/api-reference/default/client_reference-appraisal-acv"
/>

# Reset an ACV Calculation

When performing this action, the ACV value will be reset to the current value of the RCV.

<EndpointButton
  title="ACV Reset Calculation Endpoint"
  href="/api-reference/default/client_reference-appraisal-acv-1"
/>

# Retrieve RCV and/or ACV Values

The RCV and ACV values are stored (if available) in each appraisal object and can be retrieved
by either the full client reference or an individual appraisal.

Appraisals that have been added by the ValueChecker Customer Portal or by a Sheet Import are
automatically processed and will have both the RCV and ACV calculated values available.

Appraisals that your implementation adds will need to be calculated manually by using the step
outlined in [Step 5.1. Perform an ACV Calculation](/api-reference/acv-calculations#perform-an-acv-calculation).

Example for retrieving RCV and ACV values from a client_reference:

<EndpointButton
  title="Retrieve ACV & RCV from Client Reference Endpoint"
  href="/api-reference/default/client_reference-appraisal"
/>

Example for retrieving RCV and ACV values from an appraisal:

<EndpointButton
  title="Retrieve ACV & RCV from Appraisal Endpoint"
  href="/api-reference/default/client_reference-appraisal-3"
/>
