<Warning>
The endpoint **/client_reference** has restricted availability. Any
calls to it will result in a 404 response. You can request access from
your ValueChecker representative.
</Warning>

ValueChecker is able to calculate payouts (before standard deductions
apply) by using the depreciation values provided by the insurance
company. This is accomplished by providing user-input parameters like
the date of damage and the date of purchase in the request -- along with
other, previously obtained parameters detailed below.
