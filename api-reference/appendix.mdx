## Definitions
**Claimed Product (CP)**
* The product being claimed by the policyholder.

**Item of Loss**
* The item being claimed by the policyholder.


**Replacement Product (RP)**
* The product identified by ValueChecker and/or the Claims Handler to
replace the product being claimed by the policyholder. Note: This can be
the same product as the Claimed Product - if still available on the
market at a reasonable price - or a different product of the same
Like-Kind-and-Quality (LKQ).


**Replacement Cost Value (RCV)**
* The cost to replace the Claimed Product at the time of damage, thus
the price to purchase the Replacement Product (RP).


**Actual Cash Value (ACV)**
* The calculated value of the Claimed Product after applying the
insurer’s depreciation rules. Thus the ACV = RCV - Depreciation.


**Depreciation**
* A reduction - based on the rules of the insurer - in the value of the
Claimed Product over time, due in particular to wear and tear.


**vcid**
* Identifier assigned to very specific groupings of similar products in
ValueChecker, that have the same or similar price regardless of model.\
Example: "Apple iPhone 7 32GB Gold", "Apple iPhone 7 32GB Black", etc.
    <Note>
    One vcid can only have 1 alid.
    </Note>


**alid**
* Identifier assigned to broad groupings of similar products in
ValueChecker, that are of the same model family but can have.\
Example: Apple iPhone 7.
    <Note>
    One alid can have many vcid’s.
    </Note>

**Like-Kind-and-Quality (LKQ)**
* A condition in property insurance policies that states that the
insurer would cover the cost of repairing or replacing a covered loss
("Claimed Product") with property ("Replacement Product") that is
similar in composition and quality. The ValueChecker is calculating the
Replacement Products for all Claimed Products that are in the
Replacement Categories, based on multiple relevant product
specifications defined for each individual category. As a general rule,
for all Replacement Categories the Replacement Products should be of the
same Brand and not of an older model family compared to the Claimed
Product.


**User**
* The individual who uses ValueChecker during the claim handling
process. This could be a Claim Handler or a Policyholder.


## Event Codes
### Event Segments
Events codes are 6 character long strings constructed using segments
that can be parsed to identify the error reason and API resource.

There are 3 segments totalling 6 characters:
**ABCDEF**

The segment comprising the 1st and 2nd character denotes the Event
Severity.

| Segment | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **POS(1,2)** | Position 1 and 2 of the Event Code: SEVERITY |
| ER | Prefix segment for events of severity `ERROR` |
| WA | Prefix segment for events of severity `WARN` |
| IN | Prefix segment for events of severity `INFO` |

<Note>
`WARN` and `INFO` events are not currently implemented as of this
documentation. They will be added in an upcoming release.
</Note>

### ERROR Events
Calls to the ValueChecker API that result in an error for any reason
will result in an error response. These event codes begin with **ER**.

```json 400
{
    "event_code": "ERIPCS",
    "event_dict": {
        "event_severity": "ERROR",
        "title": "Invalid parameter",
        "description": "The \"client_category_id\" parameter is invalid. The value must be an integer."
    },
    "error": "Invalid parameter",
    "description": "The \"client_category_id\" parameter is invalid. The value must be an integer.",
}
```

<Info>
The root keys of `error` and `description` are maintained for backwards
compatibility and can be safely ignored. They are deprecated and will be
removed in an upcoming release.
</Info>

### Error Segment
The segment comprising the 3rd and 4th character denotes the Error type
(when the first segment is **ER**).\
The segment comprising the 5th and 6th character denotes the Error
location (resource).

| Segment | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **POS(3,4)** | Position 3 and 4 of the Event Code: Type |
| AE | Resource already exists |
| IP | A passed parameter(s) is invalid (i.e. expecting INT, got STRING) |
| IT | The bearer token is invalid |
| MP | A required parameter is missing |
| NA | Method requested is not allowed |
| NF | Resource is not found |
| WP | The value of passed parameter is wrong |
| **POS(5,6)** | Position 3 and 4 of the Event Code: Location |
| SS | The error was raised from /search_suggestion |
| PS | The error was raised from /product_search |
| PR | The error was raised from /prices |


## Status Codes
All status codes are standard HTTP status codes.\
The following status codes are used by the ValueChecker API.

| Status Code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 200 | OK |
| 204 | No Content |
| 400 | Bad Request |

### OAuth Authentication
<Warning>
Deprecated at version 0.12.45
</Warning>

ValueChecker uses the [OAuth 2.0](https://www.oauth.com/) standard for
authentication.\
Currently the authentication process of a new user to the system is
handled internally by ValueChecker. You will be sent an access_token.
(Type: **Bearer Token**.)\
To get started using ValueChecker’s API, use the access_token as
required for every request. Ask your ValueChecker contact for more
information. 

To include the access_token in a request, include it as an
“Authorization” header.

```bash curl example
curl \
-H "Authorization: apiKey zcwPhya.S23UR5cN....xFWLdKq2KRLX" \
-X GET https://api.valuechecker.net/<endpoint>?query=param1&param2=40&param3=-1
```
