import { EndpointButton } from '/snippets/endpoint-button.mdx';

These calls will be used to get parameter values needed for other calls.
Since we are continuously improving our service, we recommend that our
clients call these endpoints once a month to account for changes or
additions we make to the system.  

## Get Client Information
<Info>
    `client_id`, `country_code`, and `language` are the parameters
    needed for future calls. Other parameters in the response can be 
    ignored.
</Info>

## Get Client Categories
<Info>
Client categories are not required if you intend to use [category
strings](/before-getting-started/valuechecker-api-essentials#client-category-usage).
</Info>

If you decide to use ids, the `client_category_id` values will be used in
several other requests. These ids represent each of the product
categories that we recognize, define and assign to products in our
catalog (translated in your local language). For example, Laptops, Cell
Phones, Washing Machines and Tablets are some of the categories that
will be returned.
