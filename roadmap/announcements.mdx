#### August 22nd, 2024

![title](/assets/upgrade-button.jpg)

We have moved to the Mintlify documentation SAAS and now proudly offer OpenAPI Specification
downloads to all our implementation partners (use the "OAS" button at the top right in the header).

The ValueChecker API documentation will **no longer be maintained** at the previous links for Google Docs or
Portable Document Format (PDF).

Changes to the API and the documentation will be announced here in this section.
