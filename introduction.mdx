### Service Concept
ValueChecker is the global standard for product appraisals. This
includes product identification and best Like-Kind-and-Quality
replacement suggestions. Using artificial intelligence, advanced
heuristic, matching and data analysis technology we provide superior and
faster results than is humanly possible.

Find any product that is available on the internet by providing the
ValueChecker API with only a description of the product. The
ValueChecker API will also handle generic products (like shoes, pants,
shirts etc..) and find relevant and fair market prices.

### Users and Policyholders
Users are normally the Claim Handlers and Adjusters who interact with
the ValueChecker API. Traditionally, they are doing so on behalf of a
third party (such as an Insurer or a Claim Handling company).

In the case where the ValueChecker is implemented into a frontend
solution (such as First Notice of Loss), the Policyholders are the
`users`.

### Sequential Task Flow
The ValueChecker API is a wrapper on top of a robust system of data
aggregation, analysis, comparison and matching technology. To use this
system in its most powerful form and realise the maximum benefits (cost
savings, improved NPS and maximise STP claim handling) this system
should be used in a sequential manner. Each subsequent action adds
further value to the flow.

      To calculate and deliver the best Like-Kind-and-Quality replacement
      suggestions, ValueChecker needs to know what is being claimed (lost or
      damaged items). The higher the level of accuracy in describing or
      selecting the CP, the greater the precision in the replacement
      suggestions. In most cases, every action on a product should begin
      with a query to the Product Search endpoint.

      At the heart of the ValueChecker service is our Replacement Product
      technology. It calculates not only what would be suitable
      Like-Kind-and-Quality replacement products for the claimed product
      (using our internal product identifier, the PID) but also where it is
      available and at what price in the country of claim. The Replacement
      Product endpoint requires a PID.

      An Appraisal is a key data structure. It contains a pair of products
      (CP, RP) and any calculations made on them. Calculations can involve
      metadata like purchase/claim date (for depreciation) or product
      category/cost. Appraisals can be grouped in carts with user-defined
      references. Downloadable reports can be generated for single
      appraisals or groups.
