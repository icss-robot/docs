title: ValueChecker API Essentials
---

## Dynamic Settings
The ValueChecker service is country specific and has many customization
and flexible business options making the service client specific.\
It is important to build your implementation with this in mind. Settings
and access tokens (which are minted per client) should be easy to change
in value and between different clients who may be using the same
software implementation.\
Passing correct query variables with the wrong token will gain you
access to the API response but it will be empty in most cases. Please
take care in managing the tokens and corresponding settings and
configurations.

## Client Features
There are a number of features that are available to tailor the
ValueChecker API response and results to your needs. Most of these will
be set by your ValueChecker representative, but the following settings
can be requested to be toggled ON/OFF:

### _Filtered Prices_
[Filtered prices](/api-reference/replacement-product-suggestions#filtered-prices)
are removed from the [RP response](/api-reference/replacement-product-suggestions#response).
<Note>Default is `TRUE`</Note>

### _Category Correction_
Requested categories are analyzed using prediction and switched when
better results can be found in the [CP response](/api-reference/product-search#response-2).
<Note>Default is `TRUE`</Note>

### _Clustered Prices_
Prices in `non`-[core categories](/before-getting-started/valuechecker-service-concepts#core-categories)
are aggregated into [price buckets](/api-reference/product-search#aggregated-prices-a-k-a-clustered-prices)
and returned in the [CP response](/api-reference/product-search#response-2).
<Note>Default is `TRUE`</Note>

### _Category Metadata_
Category information is returned in the [CP response](/api-reference/product-search#response-2)
as a metadata object.
<Note>Default is `TRUE` for new clients. `FALSE` for existing clients until they migrate.</Note>

## Client Categories
One of ValueCheckers strengths is its ability to adapt to many types of
category configurations.\
Some clients may use 2 categories of `Telephones` and `Tablets` while
others may introduce a third middle range screen size as `Phablets`
between the 2.\
To adapt to this, we maintain a separate category taxonomy for each
client. Categories are represented by an alphanumeric string
(`client_category`) i.e. “Mobile phones” and a corresponding integer
category identifier (`client_category_id`) i.e. 12345.

To use the ValueChecker API you can pass either the `client_category`
(recommended) or the `client_category_id`. E.g, if the client category
“Tablets” has a client category id 123, then it will be equivalent to
send a request using either `client_category_id`=123 or
`client_category`=tablets.

### client_category usage
Pass the category to both the [Claimed Product](/api-reference/product-search)
and [Replacement Product](/api-reference/replacement-product-suggestions)
endpoints as a formatted string.
* The string is not case-sensitive.
* Special alphabetic characters like “ø” are converted to their ASCII
equivalent, in this case “o”.
* Spaces and other special characters like “&” and “/” are disregarded,
so the following examples are equivalent:
    * “Audio / Video” and “Audio & Video”
    * “Midi/Minisets” and “Midi / Minisets”
    * “Make-Up - Aangebroken” and “Make-Up (Aangebroken)” 
    * “Airconditioning (mobiel)” and “Airconditioning - Mobiel”

This method also holds the following advantage: any client category that
does not have a mapping (`client_category_id`) will be automatically
processed. There is no need to wait until the `client_category_id` is
issued, making the implementation process simpler and faster.

#### How this works:
1. You use a `client_category` that has never been passed to the
valuechecker API before: Example: “Android Tablets”.
2. The API identifies it as a new category and creates a new mapping for
this category using smart analysis (the extracted word “Tablets” is
equal to our core category “Tablets”).
    * If for some reason a mapping cannot be automatically assigned,
    the request will continue in the generic category of “All Other
    Products” until our QA team can manually ascertain the mapping. 
3. That mapping (your category of “Android Tablets” to our core category
“Tablets”) gets a `client_category_id` (i.e. 123) and is available in the
next request to the [Client Categories](/api-reference/query-parameter-requests#get-client-information)
endpoint.
4. You can then continue using the `client_category` or the
`client_category_id` for future requests to this category.

### client_category_id usage
To use the ValueChecker API with the identifier you must always pass
your `client_category_id` along with the request query to both the
[Claimed Product](/api-reference/product-search)
and [Replacement Product](/api-reference/replacement-product-suggestions)
endpoints.
<Warning>
    It is absolutely required that these values are correct.
    Passing an incorrect or outdated `client_category_id` will yield no
    results!
</Warning>
We provide a [Client Categories](/api-reference/query-parameter-requests#get-client-categories)
endpoint where you can fetch these values on demand to store them in a
dynamic manner. These identifiers do not change often, but it is good
practice to keep them regularly updated in an automated way.

## All Other Products
We maintain a generic category named “All Other Products”. It may be
called a different name according to your locale. You can find it in the
Client Categories endpoint.\
We recommend if you do not know the category in a particular search to
omit sending any category information as our category prediction will
find the best result based on analysis of the search string.\
If you are not able to omit the category parameter, we recommend the
user be able to enter the category as best as they can describe it using
the `client_category` (string) parameter.\
In the last resort cases you may use this category for any searches
where you are not sure of the category or cannot find a suitable
category or do not wish to allow the user to define their category.

## Session Identifiers
A session identifier is a unique string passed as a parameter in certain
requests that can be used by ValueChecker to aggregate actions by a
single end user (i.e. a user of your integration).\
This string can be:
* a hashed value of a username or account id from your integration.
* an application or framework assigned session id.
* any other uniquely generated string - per end user.
We use this identifier in our system health checks, anonymized usage
analysis, and to help detect anomalies in your integration. 

## Multi-Client Users (MCU)
If a user account is MCU enabled, you may use that user accounts API key
to call data for any client that the user has permission to access.
* Use the parameter `client_id` to specify which client you are requesting
data from.
* If you request a client that you do not have access to, you will
receive an error response.
* If your user is MCU enabled, the `client_id` is a required parameter on
most endpoints. It is good practise to include the `client_id` in all your
requests by default so that you do not need to make code change when
enabling/disabling MCU.
* If you send the parameter `client_id` when not MCU enabled, it is
ignored with a 200 response.
* If your user should be MCU enabled but is not, please contact
support@valuechecker.ai
